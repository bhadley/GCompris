        <manual>There are two levels in this game. 
        
        In level one, players should clikc on the question marks. A new screen will 
        appear with the animal name, a short description about hte animal, and a picture
        of the animal. There will be a multiple choice question in the bottom right. Select
        the correct answer from the choices. If you get it correct, you receive a point. When you
        have answered the question correctly, return to the main page and click on a different animal.
        The level is won when all questions have been answered correctly.
        
        In level two, a random animal sound is played and you must choose which animal
        makes that sound. Click on the question mark that corresponds to the animal you
        hear. If you'd like to hear the animal sound repeated, click on the play button.
        When you have matched all animals correctly, you win!
