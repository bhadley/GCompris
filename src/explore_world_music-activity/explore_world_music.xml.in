        <description>Learn about the music of the world</description>
        <prerequisite>None</prerequisite>
        <goal>Develop a better understanding of the variety of music present in the world</goal>
        <manual>There are two levels in this activity.
        In the first level, when you click on a suitcase, a new screen will appear
        that displays the name of the location you have selected, a brief description
        of the music there, and a picture. There is a multiple choice quesiton in the lower
        right that you must answer. After answering it correctly, return to the home screen
        and select another location. You win the level when you have answered all questions correctly.
        
        The second level is a matching game. You will hear a clip of music, and you
        must select the location that corresponds to that music. Click the play button
        if you'd like to hear the music again. You win the level when you have correctly
        matched all sound clips.</manual>
