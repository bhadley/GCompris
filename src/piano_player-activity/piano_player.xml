        This activity has six levels. Each level adds a new function to explore.
        The final level, level six, provides all functions and can be used
        as a composition tool for students to save and load their work.
        Each level adds one additional feature while keeping the previous feature
        as an option.
        
        The levels:
        1. treble clef
        2. bass clef
        3. quarter, half, and whole notes
        4. black keys as sharp notes
        5. black keys as flat notes
        6. load and save
