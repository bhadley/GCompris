        <manual> 
        This activity has eight levels. The first level and the fourth level
        introduce two different staffs with a C major scale. The following three
        levels then quiz the player on note names. To help learn the names, the
        note pitches are player when the mouse is rolled over the note, and the
        pitch names can be color coded.
        
        Here are the levels:
        1. treble clef staff
        2. note-identification: white key treble notes
        3. note-identification: sharp notes
        4. note-identificaiton: flat notes
        5. bass clef staff
        6. note-identification: white key bass notes
        7. note-identification: sharp notes
        8. note-identification: flat notes
        
        It is recommended that you begin with color-coding and pitch sound on, 
        then turn them off and test your skills.
