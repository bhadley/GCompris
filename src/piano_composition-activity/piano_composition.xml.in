        <goal>Develop an understanding of music composition, and increase interest in making music with a piano keyboard. 
        This activity covers many fundamental aspects of music, but there is much more to explore about music composition. 
        If you enjoy this activity but want a more advanced tool, try downloading MuseScore (http://musescore.org/en/download), 
        an open source music notation tool.</goal>
        <manual>This activity has several levels, each level adds a new functionality to the previous level.
        Level 1: basic piano keyboard (white keys only) and students can experiment with clicking the colored rectangle keys to write music
        Level 2: the musical staff switches to bass clef, so pitches are lower than in previous level
        Level 3: option to choose between treble and bass clef, additional function includes option to select note duration (quarter, half, and whole notes)
        Level 4: addition of black keys (sharp keys)
        Level 5: flat notation used for black keys
        Level 6: all features available, with the additional feature to load and save your composition

			1: C
