        <title>Play Rhythm!</title>
        <description>Learn to listen to, read, and play musical rhythms!</description>
        <prerequisite>simple understanding of musical rhythm and beat</prerequisite>
        <goal>learn to beat rhythms precisely and accurately based on what you see and hear</goal>
        <manual>This is a relatively challenging game to master, so good luck.
        Listen to the rhythm played, and follow along with the music. If you would like
        to ear it again, click the play button. When you're ready to perform the identical rhythm,
        click the drum to the rhythm, then click the ok button. If you clicked correctly and in the right
        tempo, another rhythm is displayed. If not, you must try again.
        If you have difficulty, try turning on the metronome. This will beat quarter notes regularly, and 
        you should be able to count note durations based on these quarter notes.
        
        You can also watch the scrolling vertical line and click whenever it hits a note.
        
        The following keyboard bindings work in this game:
		backspace: erase attempt
		delete: erase attempt
		enter/return: ok button
		space bar: play
