        <title>Play Rhythm!</title>
        <description>Learn to listen to, read, and play musical rhythms!</description>
        <prerequisite>simple understanding of musical rhythm and beat</prerequisite>
        <goal>learn to beat rhythms precisely and accurately based on what you see and hear</goal>
        <manual>This is a relatively challenging game to master, so good luck.
        
        Listen to the rhythm played, and follow along with the music. If you would like
        to hear it again, click the play button. When you're ready to perform the identical rhythm,
        click the drum to the rhythm, then click the ok button. If you clicked correctly and in the right
        tempo, another rhythm is displayed. If not, you must try again.
        
        Even levels display a vertical playing line when you click the drum, which helps you
        see whene to click to follow the rhythm. Click on the drum when the line is in the
        middle of the notes.
        
        Odd levels are harder, because there is no vertical playing line. The rhythm will
        not be played for you. You must read the rhythm, and click it back in tempo. Click
        the metronome to hear the quarter note tempo.

		backspace: erase attempt
		delete: erase attempt
		enter/return: ok button
		space bar: play
